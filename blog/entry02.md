### Context 
When researching software and hardware about animation, i found many apps and gagdets that help animators draw. At the start of my reseacrhing process, i searched up **animation apps** and the first website i clciked was called [Moho] (https://moho.lostmarble.com/pages/try). There was a pay wall in between the feayures of the app, so i decided to add the word free to my google search. I found a website called [Powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com/video-templates) after searching up **animation apps free**. In this website it was free to make a account, however the animation was mainly for advirtisments, and i learned animation can be used for marketing as well as entirtainment.
