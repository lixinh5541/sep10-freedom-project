### Context 
When researching software and hardware about animation, i found many apps and gagdets that help animators draw. At the start of my reseacrhing process, i searched up "animation apps" and the first website i clciked was called [Moho](https://moho.lostmarble.com/pages/try). There was a pay wall in between the feayures of the app, so i decided to add the word free to my google search. I found a website called [Powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com/video-templates) after searching up "animation apps free". In this website it was free to make a account, however the animation was mainly for advirtisments, and i learned animation can be used for marketing as well as entirtainment. Another website was [DotYeti](https://www.dotyeti.com/blog/top-free-2d-animation-software-of-2024-list/), which gave me tips to choose the best apps for beginners. Some of the tips were consider what type of animation your doing so you could get more capacity tools in that area, look for apps that weren't too advanced and easy to understand, and read reviews. It also gave me a list of apps that specialize in animation, and i clicked on one called [stykz](https://www.stykz.net/). I really liked this one because there was frames which was what i was looking for in animation, looks simple to use, and was free. Then my recearch of hardware strted wih me searching up “animation hardware”. The first website, [DeeDeeStudio](https://www.deedeestudio.net/en/post/types-equipment-needed-animation-studio) showed different equipment used in animation like the graphic tablet, and stylus pen. The graphic tablet is just the device where you draw, and the stylus pen is what you use to draw on the tablet. I wanted to get more specific, because i couldnt find anything, so i search “what are the physical tools used in animation”, and got a website called [lesley](https://lesley.edu/article/tools-and-technology-that-animators-game-designers-visual-effects-vfx-artists-use). I learned that sometimes animators use 3D printers to make 3D art but the rest of the items didnt use electricity and i wanted gadget that use electricity so i searched up “physical tools used in animation that use electricity”. This landed me on the website, [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/tools-and-equipment-for-hand-drawn-animation/83779506), which showed me tons of gadgets. Some of the hardware were an animation light box used to light up paper to clearly see all the layers of drawings, a camcorder which is like a camera but explicitly used to record videos, and the last hardware i found is a scanner which capture images from a paper you put in and uploads them to your computer for editing.

### EDP 
We are at the second step of the engineering design process which is researching about the problem. I learned from my research of all the comblicated tools used in animation which could be used to educate poeple on how animation works. The next step would be to brainstorm solutions and ill do this by talking with my peers and shraing my ideas

##### How to google
Using google was the main way i researched about animation, so i learn how to get better at it. I learned to be more specific with my word choice to get the results i want. Some hardware i found didnt use electricity and i needed one that uses it, so i
