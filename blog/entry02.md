### Context 
When researching software and hardware about animation, i found many apps and gagdets that help animators draw. At the start of my reseacrhing process, i searched up **animation apps** and the first website i clciked was called [Moho] (https://moho.lostmarble.com/pages/try). There was a pay wall in between the feayures of the app, so i decided to add the word free to my google search. I found a website called [Powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com/video-templates) after searching up **animation apps free**. In this website it was free to make a account, however the animation was mainly for advirtisments, and i learned animation can be used for marketing as well as entirtainment. Another website was [DotYeti](https://www.dotyeti.com/blog/top-free-2d-animation-software-of-2024-list/), which gave me tips to choose the best apps for beginners. Some of the tips were consider what type of animation your doing so you could get more capacity tools in that area, look for apps that weren't too advanced and easy to understand, and read reviews. It also gave me a list of apps that specialize in animation, and i clicked on one called [stykz](https://www.stykz.net/). I really liked this one because there was frames which was what i was looking for in animation, looks simple to use, and was free. Then my recearch of hardware strted wih me searching up “animation hardware”
