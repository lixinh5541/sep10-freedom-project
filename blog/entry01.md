I choose animation for my freedom project topic because I am pretty passionate about it. I really like how animation isnt anything special, but just drawings put together. Two things i like are key parts of animation which are drawing and putting the finished drawing together. I really enjoy drawing, and although im not great, it calms my mind in stressful moments. Even just small doodles make me happy because they are cute. The sastifaction of completing something big like a project is something to look forward too while making an animimation. Back in middle school, I had this one project where i had to made a short film in stop motion. Although making the film was tediuos and boring, the end result brought a lot of joy which i would expect to see in an animation. My backup ideas were cooking and farming because when i was young i always wanted to have these skills.
