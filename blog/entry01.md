###Choosing the topic
I choose animation for my freedom project topic because I am passionate about it. I really like how animation isnt anything special, but just many drawings put together. The key parts of animation are drawing and putting the finished drawing together which i enjoy doing. I really enjoy drawing, and the sastifaction of completing something big like a project is something to look forward too. Back in middle school, I had this one project where i had to made a short film in stop motion. Although making the film was tediuos and boring, the end result brought a lot of joy which would also be in an animation. One article that stood out to me was (https://reflector.uindy.edu/2022/09/28/mistreated-and-misunderstood-the-entertainment-industry-doesnt-understand-animation/) because it had the same ideas i was thinking. HAving the confort that i am not alone with my thoughts on animation helps me not be embarraresed by this topic. My backup ideas were cooking and farming because when i was young i always wanted to have these skills.
