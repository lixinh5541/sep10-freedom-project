### Choosing the topic
I chose animation for my freedom project topic because I am passionate about it. I like how animation isn't anything special, but just many drawings put together. The key parts of animation are drawing and putting the finished drawing together which I enjoy doing.  I enjoy drawing, and the satisfaction of completing something big like a project is something to look forward to. Back in middle school, I had this one project where I had to make a short film in stop motion. Although making the film was tedious, the result brought a lot of joy which would also be in an animation. One article that stood out to me was "[https://reflector.uindy.edu/2022/09/28/mistreated-and-misunderstood-the-entertainment-industry-doesnt-understand-animation/]" because it had the same ideas I was thinking. Having the comfort that I am not alone with my thoughts on animation helps me not be embarrassed by this topic. My backup ideas were cooking and farming because when I was young I always wanted to have these skills. 

### Engineering Design Process
I am on the first step of the engineering design process, and I have to define a problem to fix about animation. The problem I'd like to talk about is that people think animation is inferior to other methods of entertainment. The next stage is the researching of the problem and I plan to use articles and websites. I also would like to ask my classmates for their opinions on Animation.

### Skills I've learned
#### How to google
When I put in animation into my search bar, I realized that the websites and articles had nothing to do with what I had in mind. Instead of finding articles about animators or what animation impacted, I got websites to watch different animations. This is where learned i to be specific so I can eliminate any websites that aren't useful to me. Another thing I did was skim through many articles because I found out that I wasn't going to find an article that suited me on the first try. 

#### Time management
I learned that having this skill is very important because I suffered when I didn't hand in my assignments on time. I stayed up late to play video games and brushed off my work until it was too late. I kept pushing it day by day and eventually, I had to do them before the marking period ended. One of the things I learned that helped me with this skill was google tasks. This helped me a ton as in school I can directly write my homework in case I forget later. I will try to hand in my assignment on time, so i don't have a bunch of work at the end of the marking period next time.
